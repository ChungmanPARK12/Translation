### English Translation 

Fusion energy is a method of generating power by artificially reproducing nuclear fusion reactions between atomic nucleus.

In starts like the Sun, hydrogen atoms fuse into helium under conditions of extreme heat and pressure, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process. 

For this reason, fusion power is often described as the process of creating an "artificial sun".
