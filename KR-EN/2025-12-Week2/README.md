Oracle has been focusing not only on data integration but also on enhancing performance.  
The **“Data Lake Accelerator”** is a serverless technology designed to automatically process large volumes of data in parallel, improving scalability.

The newly introduced feature, **“Exadata Table Caching,”** significantly enhances repeated query performance by preloading and caching data stored in object storage onto Exadata servers.

According to Ozbutun, internal tests confirmed **up to a fivefold improvement in performance** compared to previous benchmarks.

## 🔧 How I Work (Quality & Reliability)

I use AI tools as part of my workflow — not to translate for me, but to support the process.  
Here’s how I keep things accurate and trustworthy:

- I first create my own draft based on the original text.  
- Then I use AI to compare nuance options and check alternative expressions.  
- For unclear or tricky phrases, I run quick Google searches to confirm if certain terms are actually used in real-world contexts.  
- Since machine translation isn’t perfect, I never rely on it 100%.  
- Every decision — vocabulary, tone, and final phrasing — is manually reviewed and refined for clarity and natural flow.

This approach helps me deliver translations that are **accurate, natural, and dependable** for clients.
