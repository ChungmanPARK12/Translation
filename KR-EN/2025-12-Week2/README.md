Oracle has been focusing not only on data integration but also on enhancing performance.  
The **“Data Lake Accelerator”** is a serverless technology designed to automatically process large volumes of data in parallel, improving scalability.

The newly introduced feature, **“Exadata Table Caching,”** significantly enhances repeated query performance by preloading and caching data stored in object storage onto Exadata servers.

According to Ozbutun, internal tests confirmed **up to a fivefold improvement in performance** compared to previous benchmarks.
