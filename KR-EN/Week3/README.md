### English Translation 

Analyses show that youth employment has declined significantly in industries heavily exposed to artificial intelligence (AI) following the rise of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. 

Simple tasks in fields like computer programming, publishing design, and education-related work have been rapidly replaced by AI.

In contrast, employment among seniors aged 50 and older – particularly those in organizational and managerial roles has relatively increased.
