### English Translation 

Oracle has been focusing not only on data integration  
but also on enhancing performance.

The **“Data Lake Accelerator”** is a serverless technology  
designed to automatically process large volumes of data in parallel,  
thereby improving scalability.

The newly introduced feature, **“Exadata Table Caching,”**  
significantly enhances repeated query performance  
by preloading and caching data stored in object storage  
onto Exadata servers.

According to Ozbutun, internal tests confirmed  
**up to a fivefold improvement in performance**  
compared to previous benchmarks.
