## How I Work (Quality & Reliability)

I use AI tools as part of my workflow to support **consistency** and **terminology** checks, while all translation decisions are made manually.

Here’s how I keep things accurate and trustworthy:

- I first create my own draft based on the original text.  
- Then I use AI to compare nuance options and check alternative expressions.  
- For unclear or tricky phrases, I run quick Google searches to confirm if certain terms are actually used in real-world contexts.  
- Since machine translation isn’t perfect, I never rely on it 100%.  
- Every decision — vocabulary, tone, and final phrasing — is manually reviewed and refined for clarity and natural flow.

This approach helps me deliver translations that are **accurate, natural, and dependable** for clients.
