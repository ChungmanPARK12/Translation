## How I Work (Quality & Reliability)

I use AI tools selectively to support **consistency** and **terminology checks**, while all translation decisions are made manually.

My workflow is simple and controlled:

- I produce my own draft based on the source text
- I maintain and reference a **self-built glossary** to ensure consistent terminology
- For unclear or nuanced expressions, I verify real-world usage through targeted searches
- Consistent focus on delivering **accurate**, **natural**, **reliable** 

I believe no translation is ever 100% perfect, which is why I rely on repeated **review**, **revision**, and **validation**.
