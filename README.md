## How I Work (Quality & Reliability)

I’m not a translator. I’m someone who carries meaning

I don’t settle for the first acceptable expression, and I don’t let a single phrase slide

I give language its flavor for the reader, while preserving precision, clarity, and flow

My workflow is simple and controlled:

- I produce my own draft based on the source text
- I maintain and reference a **self-built glossary** to ensure consistent terminology
- For unclear or nuanced expressions, I verify real-world usage through targeted searches
- Consistent focus on delivering **accurate**, **natural**, **reliable** 

I believe no translation is ever 100% perfect, which is why I rely on repeated **review**, **revision**, and **validation**.
